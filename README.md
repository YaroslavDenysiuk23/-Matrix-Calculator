# Matrix Calculator

## :book: Description

**Matrix Calculator** is a console-based Python program for performing various matrix operations.

It supports:

- Entering new matrices (real and complex numbers)
- Adding and subtracting matrices
- Multiplying matrices
- Multiplying matrices by a scalar
- Transposing matrices
- Calculating the determinant
- Finding the inverse of a matrix
- Computing the rank of a matrix
- Displaying the current matrix

> :information_source: **Note:** Complex numbers are supported. You can use `i` instead of `j` (e.g., `3+2i`).
